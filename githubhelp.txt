BREAKDOWN:
- "remote add" = adds a new remote repository
- "origin" = standard name for main remote repository
- URL = location of GitHub repository

WHAT IT DOES:
- Stores GitHub repository URL in Git configuration
- Creates reference point for push/pull operations
- Enables synchronization between local and remote code

6. Check Current Branch
----------------------
Command: git branch

WHY WE USE IT:

Common Git Workflow with Explanations:
====================================

Daily Development Workflow:
1. Make changes to files
   WHY: Implement features, fix bugs, update documentation
   
2. git add .                    # Stage all changes
   WHY: Prepare changes for commit, select what to include
   
3. git commit -m "message"      # Commit with message
   WHY: Save changes permanently, create restore point
   
4. git push origin main         # Push to GitHub
   WHY: Share changes, backup code, collaborate with team

WORKFLOW BEST PRACTICES:
- Commit frequently with small, focused changes
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Pull before pushing to avoid conflicts
- Test code before committing

For New Projects with Explanations:
==================================

1. git init
   WHY: Initialize version control for new project
   WHEN: Starting a brand new project from scratch
   
2. git add .
   WHY: Stage all initial project files for first commit
   WHAT: Includes all files in current directory
   
3. git commit -m "Initial commit"
   WHY: Create first snapshot of project
   BEST PRACTICE: Use "Initial commit" as standard first message
   
4. git remote add origin <repository-url>
   WHY: Connect local repository to GitHub
   REQUIREMENT: GitHub repository must exist first
   
5. git branch -M main
   WHY: Use modern branch naming convention
   REPLACES: Old "master" branch naming
   
6. git push -u origin main
   WHY: Upload project to GitHub and set tracking
   BREAKDOWN: -u sets upstream for future pushes

Troubleshooting Commands with Explanations:
==========================================

If push is rejected:
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
- Remote repository has content not in local repository
- Git prevents overwriting remote history
- Common when GitHub repo created with README

WHY THIS COMMAND WORKS:
- Downloads remote changes first
- Merges remote and local histories
- --allow-unrelated-histories forces merge of separate repos

WHEN TO USE:
- First push to existing GitHub repository
- Merging repositories with different origins
- Combining separate development histories

If merge conflicts occur:
1. Edit conflicted files manually
2. git add <resolved-files>
3. git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
4. git push origin main

WHY CONFLICTS HAPPEN:
- Same lines modified in both local and remote
- Git cannot automatically decide which version to keep
- Human intervention required

CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROCESS:
1. Open conflicted files in editor
2. Look for conflict markers (<<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>)
3. Choose which content to keep or combine both
4. Remove conflict markers
5. Save file and stage with git add
6. Commit the resolution

CONFLICT MARKERS EXPLAINED:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your local changes
=======
Remote changes
>>>>>>> branch-name

Reset to last commit (careful!):
git reset --hard HEAD

WHY USE IT:
- Undo all uncommitted changes
- Return to last committed state
- Fix severely broken working directory

DANGER WARNING:
- Permanently deletes all uncommitted work
- Cannot be undone
- Use only when you want to lose all changes

SAFER ALTERNATIVES:
- git stash (temporarily save changes)
- git checkout -- filename (reset single file)
- git reset --soft HEAD~1 (undo last commit but keep changes)

WHEN TO USE:
- Working directory is completely broken
- Want to start over from last commit
- Accidentally modified many files

View differences:
git diff

WHY USE IT:
- See exactly what changed in files
- Review changes before committing
- Understand what modifications were made

VARIATIONS:
- git diff (unstaged changes)
- git diff --staged (staged changes)
- git diff HEAD (all changes since last commit)
- git diff branch1 branch2 (compare branches)

WHAT IT SHOWS:
- Lines added (green, +)
- Lines removed (red, -)
- File names and line numbers
- Context around changes

USE CASES:
- Reviewing changes before commit
- Understanding what teammate changed
- Debugging when code stopped working
- Preparing commit messages

Advanced Troubleshooting:
========================

Undo last commit (keep changes):
git reset --soft HEAD~1

WHY: Removes last commit but keeps changes staged
WHEN: Committed too early or wrong commit message

Undo last commit (lose changes):
git reset --hard HEAD~1

WHY: Completely removes last commit and changes
DANGER: Permanently loses work

See what changed in specific commit:
git show <commit-hash>

WHY: Examine specific commit in detail
WHEN: Investigating when bug was introduced

Temporarily save changes:
git stash

WHY: Save work without committing
WHEN: Need to switch branches with uncommitted changes

Restore stashed changes:
git stash pop

WHY: Bring back temporarily saved changes
WHEN: Ready to continue work after switching back

Create branch from specific commit:
git checkout -b new-branch <commit-hash>

WHY: Start new development from specific point
WHEN: Need to branch from older commit
