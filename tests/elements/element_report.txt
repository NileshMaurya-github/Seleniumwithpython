TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED
=================================

1. AD OVERLAY RESOLUTION
-----------------------
Problem: DemoQA website ads were blocking clickable elements
Solution: Implemented JavaScript clicks using execute_script()
Code: self.driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", element)
Impact: Eliminated all ad-related click interception issues

2. ELEMENT SCROLLING
-------------------
Problem: Elements sometimes outside viewport
Solution: Added scrollIntoView for better element visibility
Code: self.driver.execute_script("arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true);", element)
Impact: Improved element interaction reliability

3. ENHANCED ERROR HANDLING
-------------------------
Problem: Tests failing completely on single element issues
Solution: Added try-catch blocks with descriptive error messages
Impact: Graceful degradation and better debugging information

4. DETAILED LOGGING
------------------
Problem: Limited visibility into test execution steps
Solution: Added comprehensive logging for each test action
Impact: Better test monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities

5. ROBUST WAIT STRATEGIES
------------------------
Problem: Timing issues with dynamic content
Solution: Implemented explicit waits with expected conditions
Impact: More reliable test execution across different environments
